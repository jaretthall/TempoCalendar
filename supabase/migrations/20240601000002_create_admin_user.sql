-- This is a placeholder migration to create an admin user
-- In a real application, you would use the Supabase dashboard to create users
-- or implement a proper signup flow

-- Note: This is just to demonstrate the concept. In a real app, you would never
-- store passwords in migrations or create users this way.

-- The actual user creation would happen through the Supabase Auth API or dashboard
